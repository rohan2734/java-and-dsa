* interfaces are the extension of abstract class

* we can think of a interface as , an abstract class whose, all methods
  are abstract.
  
* if we want a class to inherit from other class, as we write exteds
* when it is an interface, we write it as implements

* we cannot inherit from more than one class, but 
  a class can do extend and implement as well 
  and we can implement from many interfaces as well
  
* if  a class has every method which is abstract, then we also 
  call it as purely abstract class
  
* any class which implements as  interface , it has 2 options
  * it can make itself as an abstract class
  * or it should implement all of the functions of the interface
  
* an interface an extend other interface also
