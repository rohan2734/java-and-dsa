* let us say we used some 5 variables and 50 bytes, 
  this is constant space  k,
* it is not dependent on n.
* space complexity of BUBBLE SORT is  k*n^0
* bigo of n^0 or  O(n^0)
* it has constant space requirement
* there is no extra space required.


* BINARY SEARCH (recursively)

* we will have logn functions, and each funciton will
  take k constant space.
* total space requirement, is klogn, and it is O(logn)
