* spanning trees : given an undirected and corrected graph  , a tree which contains all the vertices

* for a given graph we can have multiple spanning trees

ex: 
include all vertices 

* total vertices = n
* total number of edges = E =n-1 

* what are minimum spanning tree :
    weighted spanning tree

hasPath complexity o(v+E), using BFs or DFS .
