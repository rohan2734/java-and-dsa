* it is a type of data strucutre, it is used for representing real time problems
* we have some nodes but there is no pattern to the edges
* some of the vertices are connected to each other, some of them are not

* a graph is a set of vertices and edges connecting them
* we need graphs, because we cannot store data in trees

* ex ,facebook users , each of node is user, there is no tree structure here, like one user, have few users, then so on

* we have conections between users

* a tree is a graph which is connected and doesnt contain any cycle

* take input , (using adjacency matrix)
sort by weights 

* edge class 
- source 
- destination
- weight

* input -> Edge (e)
* sort the input array on weights 
* inbuilt sorting - Arrays.sort()
* implement comparable interface 
* count = 0 for edges count 
while (count !=n-1)
* pick edge on the edges array 
   current edge , we cannot add blindly into MST 
   check if there is any cycle 
   otherwise we can add the edge , 
   condiitons are based on union find 
   check the top most parent , since we need to store this also
   we need to make parent array 
   initialise array with 0,1,2,3,4.
   take parent of both , check the parents, if it is same,skip 
   if it is not same, it is safe to add in MSt 
   in output add current , count++,
