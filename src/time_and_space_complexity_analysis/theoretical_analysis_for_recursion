* theoretical analysis for recursion

	int factorial(int n){
		if ( n== 0 )
		{
			return 1;
		}
		return n*factorial(n-1);
	}
	
* here we do k1 operations for the if condition
* let us assume that n is 100, then we called the factorial(n-1),
  then we do k2 operations for getting the value and multiplying, and that work is k2
  
* but the function factorial(n-1) has also done some work, 
  now how to add that ,
* we can think like n-2 has done some work , and then n-3  and so on

* the easiest way to think is , we write a recurrance relation
