* for finding the best algorithm ,experimental analysis is not good
* because the output of the algorithm is different for same inputs
* it is dependent on the processor, that how much time it allots for running your program
* in the background, there might be other programs also

* it also depends on test case generation,
* for example, if we give a sorted array of input[]={1,2,3,4,5};
* then the insertion sort is very fast, but the selection sort is till slow
* but that doesnt mean that  insertion sort, is a good algorithm, 
* we need to code and test
* sometimes it takes 10 hours for one crore numbers.


* the solution is 
* without coding or doing experimental analysis, how do we need to know what is the time complexity
