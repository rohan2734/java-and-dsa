* linear search

* we iterate over each element, and if we have found the 
  input element we return the index,
* if not we will move to the next index

* so best case is ,when we have found the element, in the
  first index itself
* let us suppose, going to each element, checking if we have found
  and moving to next element is k operations
* then for n elements,it is kn operations
* and  the time complexity is bigo of n => O(n)
* and the worst case, is last element, and if the element is not present
