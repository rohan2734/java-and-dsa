* in ArrayList, we had to tell the array size
  because they were contiguous, elements were stored continuously.
* so in the linked list, we save them at random memory locations
* the place where we are going to store, is called node.

* for connecting them, that node, will store the address of the next node
* first node of the chain is head.
* last node of the chain is tail.

* if we want to go to the third element, then we need to traverse the first two elements,
  only then we will be able go to the third element.

* the first part of the node is the data,
* the second part of the node is the : reference to the next node of the list.
